# This is a human-maintained but ideally machine parsable mapping of names

# Where convenient, this file should be parsed versus embedding names in code,
# which is what OC_CLI does.

# Once assigned, names are not changed, so it's OK to use: `define OC_VENDOR 1
# to indicate Xilinx in some RTL code.  There doesn't yet seem to be cause to
# bring in automation to create SystemVerilog defines and such, as each board
# just needs to set a couple of these statically.

# all values in this file are in hex
